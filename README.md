# Power BI Sales Dashboard

This project is a fully interactive **Sales Dashboard** built with Power BI, designed to deliver insights into product performance, sales trends, and customer segmentation.

## 🎓 Project Background

This dashboard was developed as part of a solo capstone project during my **Data Analytics Bootcamp at Amsterdam Data Academy**, which I have now completed. All aspects of the project — from data preparation to DAX measures and visualization — were independently created by me.

The **Amsterdam Data Academy** logo was designed using AI (via ChatGPT image generation) and embedded into the dashboard as part of the final visual polish.

Power BI Sales & Returns Dashboard

## Project Overview:

This Power BI project was created as part of the Data Scientist & AI Bootcamp at Amsterdam Data Academy (Which i have now completed). It was completed entirely independently, including all data modeling, ETL processes, dashboard design, DAX development, and visual enhancements. The project showcases a comprehensive Sales & Returns analysis dashboard using Power BI.

## ETL Process and Power Query Transformations

As part of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, I navigated the Power Query interface extensively and performed multiple data preparation techniques including:

- Appending Queries: I combined two separate tables (Dim_Region 1 and Dim_Region 2) to form a unified Dim_Region New table.

- Merging Queries: The Returns table was merged with the Fact_Returns table to enable seamless integration of region-based return data.

- Data Type Conflict Resolution: The region_key column in the Fact_Returns table had mixed data types (text and numeric), which caused issues. To resolve this, I merged and replaced the values, followed by the removal of the erroneous column.

- Transformations Used:

Replace Values (used for standardizing data)

Remove Text Left of Delimiter (to clean column values)

Change Data Type, Split Columns, and Rename Columns for schema consistency

## Data Modeling & DAX:

For the data model, I used a Star Schema, where the Fact_Sales and Fact_Returns tables serve as central fact tables connected to multiple dimension tables such as Dim_Date_table, Dim_customer, Dim_products, Dim_SKU, and Dim_manager. This schema ensures optimized performance and simplifies relationships.

- Relationships: Established one-to-many relationships between fact and dimension tables based on unique identifiers.

- DAX Measures: Created custom measures for KPIs such as:

- Total Revenue

- Total Return Quantity

- Revenue Last Year

- Total Order Quantity for SKU 34

- DAX Column: Added calculated columns where necessary for additional breakdowns (e.g., categorization, time intelligence).

- Dashboard Overview

- The final dashboard visualizes key performance indicators and trends across different dimensions of the dataset. The visuals and their purposes are detailed below:

## 📊 Visual Descriptions

1. Sales Overview Card

- Metric: Total Revenue

- Insight: Displays total revenue generated (e.g. £31.9M), offering an instant understanding of sales performance.

2. Pie Chart - Sum of Product by Price Range

- Metric: Product sales distributed by price category (Premium, Budget)

- Insight: Helps segment product sales by pricing tiers to evaluate contribution per category.

3. Clustered Bar Chart - Sum of Order Quantity by Category

- Metric: Total product orders by category (e.g., Gaming, Notebooks, Ultrabooks, etc.)

- Insight: Indicates which product categories are in highest demand.

4. Line Chart - Revenue and Revenue Last Year by Month Number

- Metric: Revenue comparison over time (month-wise)

-Insight: Offers trend analysis and seasonality checks by comparing current and past year revenue.

5. Clustered Bar Chart - Revenue by Customer Membership

- Metric: Revenue generated by different membership levels (e.g., Premium, Basic)

- Insight: Assesses customer segmentation impact on revenue.

6. Table - Revenue by Manager

- Metric: Order quantity and revenue per manager

- Insight: Evaluates individual manager performance, valuable for incentive structuring or identifying training needs.

7. KPI Cards

Metric Examples:

- Total order quantity for a specific SKU (e.g., SKU 34)

- KPI card for manager "Tammara" (not the top performer, but highlighted as an example)

- Sum of Return Quantity

Insight: Highlight business-critical metrics for quick interpretation.

## Design Features & Enhancements

📌 Bookmarks: Implemented to enable seamless navigation across report views, enhancing interactivity and storytelling.

🏷️ Custom Branding: Designed and inserted a custom Amsterdam Data Academy logo into the dashboard to add professionalism and personal branding.

🎨 UI/UX Principles: Followed best practices to ensure visual consistency, such as aligned formatting, minimal clutter, meaningful colors, and data-driven labeling.

Business Impact

The dashboard provides business stakeholders with immediate, actionable insights into:

Revenue drivers by price range, category, and membership type

Managerial performance across multiple regions

Trends in customer returns, assisting in quality and satisfaction evaluations

Product-level performance indicators for inventory and marketing alignment

These insights support decisions in pricing, product development, sales strategies, and customer retention. The use of time-based DAX calculations and trend lines enables forecasting and historical comparisons, further supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Summary:

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI through a complete end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow. I applied advanced techniques in data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design. Throughout the project, I worked independently, gaining hands-on experience in transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I practiced:

- Data extraction and transformation in Power Query

- Cleaning and combining multiple datasets

- Creating a star schema data model and managing relationships

- Building calculated columns and DAX measures

- Designing an interactive dashboard with bookmarks, custom visuals, and branding

- The project highlights my ability to use Power BI to deliver real business value by creating insightful, data-driven reports.
